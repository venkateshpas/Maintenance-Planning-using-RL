# Maintenance-Planning-using-RL
Inspection and maintenance (I\&M) planning is vital for infrastructure where structural deterioration poses risks. Like railway lines in the Netherlands for example. Operators must balance the costs and risks of inaction with those of frequent inspections and repairs. This framework applies to various structures, impacting operational costs and integrity. The complexity lies in managing the uncertainty of a structure’s condition over time and the cumulative effects of actions, making it a challenging sequential decision problem.

The environment models a k-out-of-n system with five heterogeneous components in three links, requiring at least one link to be functional. Components 1 and 5 form link 1, components 2 and 3 form link 2, and component 4 is link 3. Components in each link are in series, where one component's failure leads to the link's failure. The system itself is in parallel, meaning all three links must fail for the system to fail. Components naturally deteriorate over time with a probability of moving to more severe damage states(no damage, minor damage, major damage, failure), monitored and addressed through actions of doing nothing, inspection, or repair. Repair can revert a component to its undamaged state, albeit with probabilistic success, while inspection reveals a component’s state with varying accuracy. This setup incorporates observation uncertainty and costs associated with actions: repairs and inspections incur component-level costs, while system failure imposes a high penalty, reflecting the importance of maintaining the system's integrity.
